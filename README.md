# Cat Clicker app
Welcome to my cat clicker project
## What it does
To use the app simple go to this link ( https://andrewjc88.github.io/CatClicker/ )

There you can select a cat and use the admin panel to change it's properties. I hope you enjoy!

## Why I did this
I made this app to practice designing a Model View Controller for my app to make it more easily maintainable and modular.  

## TO DO
Make css suck less.
